Farley Duvall, founder and CEO of White Bull, described the contest:

>The Bully Awards have become recognized by some as the "Oscars of European Tech." A large panel of industry experts, media, VC's and seasoned entrepreneurs review the nominated companies, to identify the diamonds in the rough on the European technology scene.

Farley Duvall continued with the motivation:

>Imint was awarded a Bully Award in the Young Bull category in 2014, for showing great agility in re-targeting their proven defense-style software algorithms to a high-growth opportunity within the consumer segment, and by having achieved substantial product progress as well as commercial traction in a short time span. The panel found that this clearly signals that Imint possess a great capability to act and execute on emerging opportunities.

On stage to receive the award was Imint's CEO Andreas Lifvendahl, and CTO Simon Mika. Andreas Lifvendahl was very satisfied with the win:

>We have received a lot of attention on what our software can do for smartphones, by improving user experience of own video clips several notches. We now have a very hectic autumn with extensive travels - many are eager to learn more about our technology and have a closer look at our prototype. To receive this award at this stage is very positive; it brings further confidence to our team, and gives us additional recognition.
